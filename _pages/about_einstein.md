Hi, my name is Gabriela Victor. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of São Paulo (USP), currently exploring areas like operating systems, graphics programming, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working on hands-on projects that blend theory and creativity.

I’m very curious and love learning about a wide range of subjects — not just in tech, but in general. Being part of the technology field feels exciting and full of possibilities. I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to grow, both academically and personally.

Some of my interests include cats (did you know there are infinite subreddit pages just for them?), simulation games like *The Sims*, internet meme culture, and cinema. I love diving into anything that blends creativity, humor, and a bit of weirdness.

 You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
